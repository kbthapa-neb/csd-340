  About
  </div>
    <p>
My name is Khadga Thapa, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience.
I am a married person with two kids; one handsome son and one beautiful daughter.  I graduated with a Business degree in 2004 from
Nepal and own business few year. Later one of my friend recommended doing IT job so I started my IT carrier since 2009.
I loved working with my all previous companies where good working environment is. After that, I stayed a full year and learned a
ton about how to programming works and I ended up becoming a very good performer in my group before leaving. I have working experience
in healthcare domain, ecommerce domain, finance domain, payment-processing domain. Since I have been working many years in same company
and there is nothing to learn new thing so I feel ready to take my career to the next level so that’s why I’m currently looking for a new opportunity.
        </p>
		        <p>
I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read books,
I like to visit new places, I like to play sports like golf and soccer, I liked to learn about new technologies, I liked listening music and singing songs,
I like to see the moonlight at night, I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter, I like country’s peace, I like delicious
food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and comedy movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
